/**
 * The pure corner geometry behind {@link RingParticle}, kept free of Minecraft client classes so
 * the pure JVM tests can pin it. Corner order is shared by both orientations:
 * {@code -u-v, -u+v, +u+v, +u-v}, where GROUND takes u=(1,0,0), v=(0,0,1) (a world-flat XZ quad,
 * built by {@link #ground}, no camera involvement so it stays horizontal) and FACING_MOTION takes
 * an orthonormal basis of the plane perpendicular to the spawn direction ({@link #facing}).
 *
 * <p>{@link #LARGEST_CANVAS} is the canvas width of the largest hand-drawn ring; every frame's
 * world size scales off it through {@link #scaleForWidth} (the {@code quadSize}
 * half-span multiplier for a frame drawn on a canvas that wide). A direction shorter than
 * {@link #MIN_DIRECTION_LENGTH} is treated as "no direction" and falls back to GROUND.
 *
 * <p>{@link #MIN_OPENING_DEGREES} is the minimum opening toward the camera, in degrees (Alex,
 * 2026-09-19): a ring perpendicular to a motion that runs sideways across the view is perfectly
 * edge-on and invisible, so the normal is tilted toward the camera enough to keep the arc legible.
 * 5° was the first try -- at that angle the big early frames of a sideways dash render as a
 * 0.19-block sliver and the trail reads small-to-large; 30° keeps the largest frame ~1.1 blocks
 * wide even edge-on. Rings already facing the viewer (punch, forward dash) sit far above the
 * threshold and are never touched.
 *
 * <p>{@link #facing} builds the quad perpendicular to {@code direction} (the ring faces along it,
 * like a shockwave riding a dash or a punch), applying the {@link #MIN_OPENING_DEGREES} tilt
 * toward {@code cameraForward} when the ring would otherwise be edge-on. A near-zero direction
 * falls back to {@link #ground(float)}; a (near-)vertical one switches the reference axis so the
 * basis never degenerates -- note a vertical normal lands on the horizontal plane anyway, matching
 * GROUND. {@link #tiltTowardCamera} rotates the normal toward the camera only while it is nearly
 * perpendicular to the view (|n·v| under sin of {@link #MIN_OPENING_DEGREES} -- the edge-on case):
 * the result keeps the normal's view-perpendicular component and gains exactly
 * {@link #MIN_OPENING_DEGREES} of opening, so the adjustment is continuous and never pops. The
 * quad is double-sided, so the sign of the dot is irrelevant.
