/**
 * The even-spacing accumulator behind the planted dash trail: how far into this tick's movement
 * segment the next rings drop. Distance-based rather than tick-based because the server-side dodge
 * movement arrives in uneven chunks (Epic Fight locks movement and lets the animation drive it),
 * so a per-tick drop clusters the rings at the start and end of the path (Alex, 2026-09-20);
 * spacing by measured travel keeps the trail uniform across windups, jumps and wall truncations.
 * {@link #SPACING} is the distance between two neighbouring rings on the dash path, in blocks.
 *
 * <p>{@link #drops} takes the distance travelled since the last drop ({@code carry}, always
 * {@code < SPACING}), this tick's movement segment length ({@code segLen}), and the rings the burst
 * may still drop ({@code ringsLeft}), and returns a {@link Drops} of where on the segment the rings
 * drop, plus the new carry and remaining ring budget; {@link Drops#offsets} are the ascending
 * offsets along this tick's segment where rings drop.
