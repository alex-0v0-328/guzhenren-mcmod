# Session Close Skill

Runs when Alex declares the goal done (Alex, 2026-09-30). Every step runs without an ask; only the `commit-push` skill's commit-message pick waits for him.

1. **Temporary files.** Delete what this task left under `C:\workspace\Dev\Projects\_Temp\guzhenren\`: its task subfolders, `logs\check.log` and `logs\ship.log`, `ship-plan.json`, once their results are reported. Regenerable output is deleted outright, anything that cannot be regenerated goes to the Recycle Bin, and nothing this task did not create is touched.
2. **Environment.** Stop what this session started and is still running: background shells and monitors, subagents, and any `runServer`, `runClient` or Gradle run the agent launched. Leave IDEA's Gradle daemons, Alex's own processes and the dashboard file alone; the `activate-dashboard` skill clears the board at its next launch.
3. **Unshipped work.** After `git fetch`, check `git status` and `git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD`. Uncommitted changes or unpushed commits → run the `commit-push` skill. Nothing left → say so.
4. **Report.** What was deleted, what was stopped, and the ship result (SHA, push, CI) or "nothing to push".
